Simple django calendar.  
Database included.  
Admin name: admin  
Admin password: adminpassword

Set SECRET_KEY to something in your settings file.  
Only route is /year/monts for example:  
localhost:8000/2023/02

Important part is in the index view. Everything else is mandatory.
There is a lot of room for improvement. Implement as You want.
